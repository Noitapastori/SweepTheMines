# Minesweeper React demo

This repo now contains a small React example app (Vite) that replaces the original static demo.

Quick start (PowerShell):
```powershell
cd C:\Users\panup\Documents\ensimmainen-sovellus
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173
```

Notes:
- The core game logic lives in `src/lib/useMinesweeper.js` as a reusable hook.
- `src/App.jsx` contains a minimal UI (Board + Controls) that preserves keyboard and ARIA behaviors.
- `package.json` includes `dev`/`build`/`preview` scripts using Vite.

If you want a TypeScript conversion, or a published library instead of an example app, tell me and I'll scaffold it.
